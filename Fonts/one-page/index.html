                <p>David Cameron is poised to return as U.K. prime minister after steering his Conservatives to an
                    unexpected majority, helped by a landslide for nationalists in Scotland at Labour’s expense.

                        deficit. The result also raises the prospect of a referendum on whether Britain should remain in
                        the
                        European Union, while the surge in support for the Scottish National Party renews questions over
                        the
