                    <p class="text-long">David Cameron is poised to return as U.K. prime minister after steering his
                        Conservatives to an
                        unexpected majority, helped by a landslide for nationalists in Scotland at Labour’s expense.

                        The pound jumped as projections of the final tally in the British general election indicated
                        that
                        the Conservatives had defied opinion polls to easily defeat Ed Miliband’s Labour Party. With
                        most
                        seats declared, the BBC forecast the Tories to take 331 of Parliament’s 650 seats to Labour’s
                        232
                        seats, a result that would allow Cameron to ditch his Liberal Democrat coalition partner of the
                        past
                        five years and govern alone.</p>

                    <p class="text-long">Cameron hailed the election outcome as the “the sweetest victory of all”
                        and a vindication of
                        the
                        Tory campaign based on his record of producing an economic recovery and cutting a record
                        budget
                        deficit. The result also raises the prospect of a referendum on whether Britain should
                        remain in
                        the
                        European Union, while the surge in support for the Scottish National Party renews questions
                        over
                        the
                        integrity of the United Kingdom just eight months after Scots voted “No” to independence.</p>

                <p class="text-long">With Cameron immediately renewing his pledge to hold a referendum on British
                    membership
                    of the European
                    Union, the result throws up questions about Britain’s constitutional future. For now, the surprise
                    victory was welcomed by markets, with stocks and the pound rallying as it became clear Cameron had
                    defied forecasts of a hung parliament to easily defeat Ed Miliband’s Labour Party and govern alone.
